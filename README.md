Dependencies
------------

1. [Phenny][]
2. [Tutor][]

[Phenny]: http://inamidst.com/phenny/

NOTE: Tutor must be installed and running on a server that is accessible from the computer that Phenny is running on.

Installation
------------

1. Copy all `.py` into Phenny's `modules` folder.
2. Edit `card.py` to replace `api_server` with the address of the server on which `Tutor` is running.
3. Edit `price.py` to include the API URL from TCG Player as well asyour partner key.
3. Start Phenny.

Commands
--------

```
.card, .sets, .flavor, .rulings, .image, .price, .article
```

### Card Search

The `.card` command searches Gatherer for a card whose name matches the given card name and returns the rules text of
the card. The rules text is said by the bot in the channel where the command was issued.

```
(09:17) Kihashi: .card Storm Crow
(09:17) CardBot: Kihashi: Storm Crow | {1}{U} | Creature  - Bird | Flying (This creature can't be blocked except by creatures with flying or reach.) | 1/2
```

NOTE: The card should list the abbreviation for the last set that it was printed at the end of its entry. If it does not, it is because Gatherer is returning a set that has not been added to the list of sets in `expansion.py`. See `Adding a New Set` below.

### Card Rulings

The `.rulings` command searches Gatherer for a card whose name matches the given name and returns a list of rulings for
the card. Note that because this command returns many statements, it is returned as a PM rather than being displayed in
the appropriate channel.

```
(09:23) Kihashi: .rulings humility
(09:23) CardBot: 2006-02-01: With a Humility and two Opalescences on the battlefield, if Humility has the latest timestamp, then all creatures are 1/1 with no abilities. If the timestamp order is Opalescence, Humility, Opalescence, the second Opalescence is 1/1, and the Humility and first Opalescence are 4/4.  If Humility has the earliest timestamp, then everything is 4/4.
(09:23) CardBot: 2007-02-01: Removes all creature abilities. This includes mana abilities. Animated lands will also lose the ability to tap for mana.
(09:23) CardBot: 2009-10-01: This is the current interaction between Humility and Opalescence: The type-changing effect applies at layer 4, but the rest happens in the applicable layers.  The rest of it will apply even if the permanent loses its ability before it's finished applying. So if Opalescence, Humility, and Worship are on the battlefield and Opalescence entered the battlefield before Humility, the following is true: Layer 4: Humility and Worship each b
(09:23) CardBot: 2009-10-01: You apply power/toughness changing effects in a series of sublayers in the following order: (a) effects from characteristic-defining abilities; (b) effects that set power and/or toughness to a specific number or value; (c) effects that modify power and/or toughness but don't set power and/or toughness to a specific number or value; (d) changes from counters; (e) effects that switch a creature's power and toughness. This card's effect 
```

### Card Editions

The `.sets` command searches Gatherer for a card whose name matches the given one and returns a list of sets the card
has been printed in as well as the card's rarity in each of these sets. The list is said by the bot in the channel
where the command was issued.

```
(11:26) Kihashi: .sets Birds of Paradise
(11:26) CardBot: Kihashi: Seventh Edition - Rare | Fourth Edition - Rare | Revised Edition - Rare | Limited Edition Alpha - Rare | Eighth Edition - Rare | Magic 2011 - Rare | Magic 2012 - Rare | Tenth Edition - Rare | Fifth Edition - Rare | Classic Sixth Edition - Rare | Unlimited Edition - Rare | Limited Edition Beta - Rare | Ravnica: City of Guilds - Rare | Magic 2010 - Rare | 
```

### Card Flavor Text

The `.flavor` command searches Gatherer for a card whose name matches the one given and returns a list of the flavor
text for each edition of the card. Note that because this command returns many statements, it is returned as a PM rather than being displayed in
the appropriate channel.

```
(11:59) Kihashi: .flavor Storm Crow
(12:00) CardBot: Ninth Edition - Storm crow descending, winter unending. Storm crow departing, summer is starting.
(12:00) CardBot: Portal - Storm crow descending, winter unending.  Storm crow departing, summer is starting.

(12:00) CardBot: Starter 1999 - Storm crow descending, winter unending.Storm crow departing, summer is starting.
```

### Card Image Link

The `.image` command searches Gatherer for a card whose name matches the one given and returns a URL to the image of the
card. The link is said by the bot in the channel where the command was issued.

```
(12:10) Kihashi: .image Pernicious Deed
(12:10)	CardBot: Kihashi: http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?name=Pernicious+Deed&type=card
```

### Article Listings

The `.article` command returns a list of the 5 latest articles from MTG: Daily, Star City, Channel Fireball, TCG Player, and Gathering Magic. It returns each article's Title, Author, and link.

```
<Kihashi> .article scg

```

Card Nicknames
--------------

Using the `nicks.py` module, it is possible for the bot to recognize alternate names for cards. Basically, the bot checks the input name against this list and replaces it with its paired name. Of course, this means that a nickname cannot be the name of another card.

### Adding a nickname

`nicks.py` contains a single python dictionary. To add another nickname, simply add another entry in the form `"nickname": "Real Name",`.

Example:

Original Text
```
"Bob": "Dark Confidant",
"Jens": "Solemn Simulacrum",
"Olle": "Sylvan Safekeeper",
"Darwin": "Avalanche Riders",
"Mike": "Rootwater Thief",
```

New Text
```
"Bob": "Dark Confidant",
"Jens": "Solemn Simulacrum",
"Olle": "Sylvan Safekeeper",
"Darwin": "Avalanche Riders",
"Mike": "Rootwater Thief",
"Newbie": "New Card",
```

Set Abbreviations
-----------------

Since Gatherer only provides us with a set's full name, mtg-irc must store a list of set abbreviations. This is impemented as a python dictionary similarly to how card nicknames are implemented. Sets can be added in the same way: `"Full Set Name": "fsn",`.
